= pretend-to-be-centos.sh

== Description

Some RPMs or scripts only support CentOS and make installing them on RHEL impossible.
Use this script to have your RHEL setup mimic CentOS by installing a CentOS `/etc/os-release`.


== Usage

```sh
./pretend-to-be-centos.sh <enable|disable>
```


=== Example enable:

```console
# ./pretend-to-be-centos.sh enable
pretend-to-be-centos.sh: system identies as 'Red Hat Enterprise Linux Server 7.5 (Maipo)'
download-centos-rpm.sh: checking 'http://mirror.centos.org/centos/7/os/x86_64/Packages/' for 'centos-release-7'
download-centos-rpm.sh: downloading 'http://mirror.centos.org/centos/7/os/x86_64/Packages/centos-release-7-5.1804.el7.centos.x86_64.rpm' to '/tmp/tmp.YEA4uDAVqm'
download-centos-rpm.sh: checking 'http://mirror.centos.org/centos/7/extras/x86_64/Packages/' for 'centos-release-7'
pretend-to-be-centos.sh: unpacking '/tmp/tmp.YEA4uDAVqm/centos-release-7-5.1804.el7.centos.x86_64.rpm'
unpack-rpm.sh: file '/tmp/tmp.YEA4uDAVqm/etc/os-release' created
pretend-to-be-centos.sh: installing '/etc/os-release' to '/etc/os-release.bak'
pretend-to-be-centos.sh: installing '/tmp/tmp.YEA4uDAVqm//etc/os-release' to '/etc/os-release'
pretend-to-be-centos.sh: system now identifies as: 'CentOS Linux 7 (Core)'
```


=== Example disable:

```console
# ./pretend-to-be-centos.sh disable
pretend-to-be-centos.sh: installing '/etc/os-release.bak' to '/etc/os-release'
```
