= rhel-centos-scripts


== Description

This repository contains several bash scripts for RHEL/CentOS


=== download-centos-rpm

The `download-centos-rpm.sh` script for CentOS and RHEL is used to download CentOS RPMs from `os` and `extras`.
The major version for the CentOS mirror URL is automagically determined by checking `/etc/os-release`.


=== pretend-to-be-centos

Some RPMs or scripts only support CentOS and make installing them on RHEL impossible.
Use the `pretend-to-be-centos.sh` script to have your RHEL setup mimic CentOS by installing a CentOS `/etc/os-release`.


=== unpack-rpm

The `unpack-rpm.sh` script unpacks a RPM or extracts a single file from a RPM.
